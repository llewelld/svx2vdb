svx2vdb
=======

Convert Simple Voxel SVX files to OpenVDB files.

The code needs to be cleaned up and a lot more testing done, but it should work for most SVX files.

For info about the SVX format, please see this post about it: http://abfab3d.com/svx-format/

For info about OpenVDB, please check the OpenVDB website: http://www.openvdb.org/

One nice benefit of converting files in this way is that it allows voxel clouds to be viewed using the vdb_view (http://www.openvdb.org/download/) utility or Houdini (http://www.sidefx.com/) tools. Currently there aren't any tools to view SVX files directly, as far as I'm aware.


Usage
=====

This is a simple command-line tool that takes two parameters.

svx2vdb infile.svx outfile.vdb

The first parameter infile.svx should be an existing SVX format file to read in. This will be converted to the OpenVDB format file written to outfile.vdb.

If you have the OpenVDB tools installed, you can then view the resulting output file as follows.

vdb_view outfile.vdb

An example SVX file is provided in the examples folder. Shapeways also provide a  sphere example (http://shapeways.com/rrstatic/files/sphere.svx), or you can generate your own files using Functy (http://functy.sourceforge.net/).


Build Me
========

You can use the autotools configure script to build svx2vdb on Linux systems. Set the current working directory to the svx2vdb folder, then enter the following.

./configure
make

If the configure step generates errors, it's likely because you need to install autotools, or one of the code dependencies listed below.

If there are no errors, this will build the svx2vdb binary in the same folder. You can then test it by converting one of the example files and viewing the result.

./svx2vdb examples/urchin.svx out.vdb
vdb_view out.vdb

You can then press the 3 key to show the voxels.

Use make install as root to install it into the path.


Dependencies
============

The current dependencies for building svx2vdb are:

1. OpenVDB (http://www.openvdb.org/) for OpenVDB voxel cloud creation.
2. OpenEXR (http://www.openexr.com/) as an OpenVDB dependency.
3. libtbb2 (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) for OpenVDB threading.
4. libpng (http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) for reading SVX slices.
5. libzip (http://www.nih.at/libzip/) for extracting SVX file contents.
6. libxml-2.0 (http://xmlsoft.org/index.html) for interpreting  the SVX manifest.

If you're using Linux, most if not all of these should be in the repositories (at least this is the case for Ubuntu 14.10 which I'm using here).
